## Run Dev

### Prerequisite
The project contains a dependency as the back-end API is located on a different repository. The following API and instructions on how to run a dev instance can be found by clicking the following link [Slapshot: Rebound OSL Back-End API](https://github.com/Haelnorr/srlm/tree/dev-0.8)
Current required version is 0.8.9.


### Steps
There are a few steps that need to be set up being you can run the website on your local machine or docker (not available as of yet). To run the project it is assumed you have npm installed and are familiar with some basic commands.

1. Clone the Repository and run the following to install and dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. In the root creat a file called `.env.development` and add the following variables.
    ```env
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=""
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=""
    DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:4321/auth/discord/callback"
    PUBLIC_DISCORD_AUTH_URI= ""
    SRLM_API_URI="http://localhost:8000/api"
    SRLM_API_APP_KEY=""
    STEAM_API_KEY=""
    STEAM_OPENID_REALM="http://localhost:4321"
    ```
    *Note: To get the discord client ID, secret and auth uri you will need register a new application with discord, or you could use a current one you might already have.*  
    *Note: The SRLM_API_APP_KEY is provided by Haelnorr the owner of the backend api repository*  
    *Note: To get a steam API key, go to [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)*

3. After that you can run the following command, and bish bosh you should be able to view the website on [localhost:4321](http://www.localhost:4321)
    ```ENV
    npm run dev
    ```
