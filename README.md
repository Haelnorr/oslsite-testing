## Run Dev
There are a few steps that need to be set up being you can run the website on your local machine or docker (not available as of yet). To run the project it is assumed you have npm installed and are familiar with some basic commands.

1. Clone the Repository and run the following to install and dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. In the root creat a file called `.env.development` and add the following variables.
    ```env
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=""
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=""
    DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:4321/auth/discord/callback"
    PUBLIC_DISCORD_AUTH_URI= ""
    ```
    *Note: To get the discord client ID, secret and auth uri you will need register a new application with discord, or you could use a current one you might already have.*

3. After that you can run the following command, and bish bosh you should be able to view the website on [localhost:4321](http://www.localhost:4321)
    ```ENV
    npm run dev
    ```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
